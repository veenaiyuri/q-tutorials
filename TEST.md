# Qiskit Documentation Localization

First of all, **thank you** for showing your interest in translating Qiskit Documentation! This helps make the documentations more accessible and available to our global community. 

If you are interested in contributing to translations, please follow the instructions below. If you find any errors or glitches in the original documentation, please feel free to open an issue as well.

### For sighing up to participate in translations:
1. Open the [LOCALIZATION_CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-translations/blob/master/LOCALIZATION_CONTRIBUTORS)file. Look for the language header that you'd like to contribute to in the PR summary and sign under there. <br/>
2. Create a pull request (PR) to merge your change. Make sure to follow the template to open a Pull Request.<br/>
      - Each contributor has to create their own PR and sign the CLA.
      - If you have an open issue for a language request, **add the issue link to the PR**.
      
3. You will be asked to sign the Qiskit Contributors License Agreement (CLA); please do so.<br/>
4. In the `Qiskit-Docs <https://crowdin.com/project/qiskit-docs>`__ Crowdin project, choose the language that you want to contribute to.<br/>
5. Click the **Join** button and **paste the URL of your PR** in the dialog box where you are asked why you want to join the Crowdin project. The administrators of the Crowdin project will review your request and give you access as quickly as they can.<br/>


### What is Crowdin?
Qiskit documentation is translated (localized) using [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), a software and web localization platform that allows organizations to coordinate translation projects and collaborate with communities to translate materials. Crowdin allows our community of translators to amplify their impact by automatically reusing the work invested translating one sentence to translate other, similar sentences. Crowdin also makes translations resilient to many types of changes to the original material, such as moving sentences around, even across files.


### For adding a new language to translate
The Qiskit Localization Project currently suppports: `Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Spanish- Mexico, and Turkish.`

As mentioned in the blog post, [Qiskit in my language is Qiskit](https://medium.com/qiskit/qiskit-in-my-language-is-qiskit-73d4626a99d3) we want to make sure that translated languages have enough community support to ensure quality and consistency.<br/>
If you want to add a new language and become a translation lead, you can open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-translations/issues/new/choose) to start a discussion with the Qiskit team and recruit translation project members.

### What is the criteria for adding a new language?
The general criteria for adding a new language is outlined below:<br/>
1. A minimum of **three contributors** are necessary for any new languages to be added to receive official support from the administrators of the localization project.<br/>
2. In addition to translators, we will need **dedicated proof-readers** to review the translations and approve accuracy of content in that language to ensure the translations to be released in that language.<br/>
#. Among the group of contributors, a **translation lead must be identified** to serve as a liaison with the administrators of the localization project. The lead must contact: Yuri Kobayashi (yurik@jp.ibm.com) by email for the language to be officially listed under this project. <br/><br/>

For further details, please feel free to contact yurik@jp.ibm.com for any questions regarding the project. Thank you.
